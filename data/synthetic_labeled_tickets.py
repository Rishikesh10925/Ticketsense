"""Inserts a small hand-authored, fully-labeled ticket set into the `tickets` table —
department, priority, AND sentiment all filled in — so the classifier
(ai/models/train_classifier.py) has something to train on.

This exists because the real external dataset (data/import_helpdesk_tickets.py) predates
the SAP/Networking/Cloud/HR taxonomy and doesn't have a sentiment field at all. Each of
these ~96 tickets is grounded in one of the 48 db/seed/knowledge_base/ articles (2 tickets
per article), phrased the way an end user would actually write it, not like the KB's SOP
text — so retrieval and classification can both be sanity-checked against the same set of
real-world issues without the labels being suspiciously identical to the KB content.

Requires seed.sql to have been applied first (needs the 4 department rows).

Usage (from backend/):
    uv run python ../data/synthetic_labeled_tickets.py [--reset]
